"""
EM algorithm to estimate individual inbreeding coefficients for NGS data using genotype likelihoods
and pre-computed allele frequencies (both sample average or individual).

Both the maximum likelihood estimator and simple estimator of the inbreeding coefficients can be computed.
The estimators can be selected by the model parameter (model=1 for MLE, model=2 for Simple).
